## Why

This is a place for high-level explanations, and should keep implementation/engineering details to the minimum. What was the motivation for this code change? Is this part of a larger job? Does it have a ticket? Is it a hotfix? etc.

## What

Provide more implementation/engineering details in this section. Ideally each set of code changes does a specific thing. If your diff does 10 things, I may ask why it isn't 10 different PRs. Help the reviewers by keeping it tidy and by providing information that aids understanding of your code.

## Why do you think this works?

You've written tests of course, but there may be some other things you did or looked at in the process of evaluating the code, don't be shy, list 'em.
